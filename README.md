# Capture The Ether

This is a Capture the flag (CTF) challenge hosted at [CaptureTheEther](https://www.capturetheether.com). This repo contains my solutions to the challenges written with Python, Brownie, and Solidity.

## Note On Security

For private key security, several setup files are not uploaded to this repo and have been included in the .gitignore file.
Several import statements reference packages I've written for decrypting my keys, and scripts/helpful_scripts.py especially references these functions.
